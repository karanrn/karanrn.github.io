I am listening to my whole life about “life” but never really made an attempt to live in the experience that lasts forever. I have added many tangible and intangible possessions and surely will have more, these timely priced possessions thought me to have just the comfortable life – just live but never gave an inkling of life with rich experience.</p><p>Self-help, philosophy, hard facts, inspiring talks, movies have their fair share in my mere living of life. Of course, I am a dedicated individual and serious about my career but not life. I have listened and followed ideals to add richness to my living, they have given me direction when I had none but I have lost navigating in the process. I understand one cannot turn back the clock to make a different choice yet I cling to my past regretting of not living to my fullest. All the philosophy and self-help books question us to question our existence and purpose, I am not equipped with the right questions (or any questions). Our elders teach us to plan for the future, I have none. I am still an individual who plans for financial independence and other dependencies. This article is no harbinger of hope in my life, I wish I had powers. All my life I wished for a richer experience, to live in the moment but I was always held back by me.</p><p>Books give you an abundance of knowledge and train your thoughts, reading is part of daily life. I always believed books will make one a better person but it never crossed my mind that books add value to your mind not the richness of its experience. I have been reading for years now yet I do not recall any experience with reading or maybe my brain is not wired to register reading as an experience of life. I am the frog in the well justifying the importance of the well.</p><p>For greater experience, one has to move away from fears and push yourself outside your comfort zone. It is easier said than done. I am not nostalgic about anything because I never made an attempt to make my life worth recollecting. I am no different than machines. Lack of these experiences has made me an empty shell. When I look back, I never struggled and never attempted at the chances of struggles in my life. This is not to convey experiences come through struggle, it is just that I never lived to my fullest to experience the struggles and fulfillment of overcoming them.</p><p>There is no agenda to the way of experiencing life to its fullest. One has to find their own ways, I am finally making an attempt to break my own barriers with one step at a time. At present, I have no life besides my work. Please build up new skills not for your career/work but for yourself.</p><p>This post is just the reflection of my life till now.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/karanrn/karanrn.github.io/commit/3a4089d3957816a7ee3767557ea58796ba1b19df title='Last modified by karan.nadagoudar | August 14, 2022' target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
