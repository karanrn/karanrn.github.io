Words are never neutral as we are bound by emotion in every action we take, with an anxious mind as mine simple statements/thoughts will take you spiraling down the bottomless pit. Long thoughts with a small pinch of worries are hard to summarize as they tend to lose their importance or hold on to the individual (read as me), it is soothing and tempting to dump your thoughts onto our journal or an article like this one. I have not grown/matured so much to have an epiphany, life is both harder and simpler with swings happening with every hour of the day.\nWise say time heals everything but all we do is forget our pain and our wounds never heal. Time makes you ignorant to your pains disguising as healing. Strong will and mind can adjust to any environment (read as a situation) but at what cost? trying to impress others, adjusting to generation-old mentalities, and whatnot. Life as I understand (or wrongly understand) is a mere reaction to the situations one faces and some of them become our regrets which imprint our tiny minds scaring one’s character and future life choices.\nWe seek humility and humbleness in the world yet we are so wrong in some of our acts. It is so easy to blame and judgmental about rich, powerful people over infamous Twitter threads or an hour-long rant with your friend yet we cannot guarantee our conscience when we become one. I do not know if situations shape us or you shape the situations that make us but at the end of the day, it is just you (and your soul if believing in it).\nLife is very short and ephemeral, neither our thoughts nor souls are immemorial. I am still learning to appreciate the beauty of it, with so many losses in close circles I am scared of my tiny life and much tinier time of it. Empathy, Humility, Memonti Mori, Amor Fati, and what not to keep your mind tied to so you come to appreciate the beauty and time in it but here I am lost in the translation of my thoughts and my experience.\nThere is no linearity or theme to this piece and it will never be complete.\nAnd if you are seeking something from this please do not, this is not wisdom to anyone.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/posts/2021/03/27/graphql-python/","title":"GraphQL: Query filtering with relay and graphene-python","section":"posts","content":"GraphQL is query language for API. It simplifies, isolates, and fastens the development and API releases. This post assumes the reader is aware of basics of GraphQL concepts like query, mutation, and schema. If you have stumbled here for introduction to GraphQL, please go through this tutorial.\nMost of the implementations on the web for GraphQL with python are using Django which packs lot of features and plugins to ease the development with tradeoff to huge code base for simple application. I will be focusing on Flask as it has lesser footprint and best suited for implementing small applications.\nRelay is a GraphQL client developed by Facebook for React. It provides pagination, caching (reusing cached data) out of the box. Graphene-Python has complete support for relay.\nA simple query with filter (without relay) to fetch books basis title:\nquery{ allBooks(title:\u0026#34;Da Vinci Code\u0026#34;){ id title } } Response from the above query:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;allBooks\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Da Vinci Code\u0026#34; } ] } } Relay uses connections, edges, and node notation to structure/format data and requests. Connections is a collection of objects containing information about edges, nodes, page, cursor, and other metadata of the page. Edges are collections of records, it helps in pagination and node is the actual record/data. More about Relay connections, edges, and node can be read here.\nI could not find easier implementation of relay with filtering using flask and graphene-python. For application to use relay, we need to add relay node to the schema for querying or mutation.\nRelay can be enabled or implemented as below:\nclass BookObject(SQLAlchemyObjectType): class Meta: model = Book interfaces = (graphene.relay.Node, ) class Query(graphene.ObjectType): node = graphene.relay.Node.Field() all_books = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(BookObject.connection) A sample query making use of relay:\nquery{ allBooks{ edges{ node{ id title } } } } A response for the above query:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;allBooks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;edges\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;node\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Qm9va09iamVjdDoz\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Da Vinci Code\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;node\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Qm9va09iamVjdDo1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TensorFlow\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;node\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Qm9va09iamVjdDo2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Deception point\u0026#34; } } ] } } } So to enable or implement filtering the query with relay can be by sub-classing SQLAlchemyConnectionField class of graphene_sqlalchemy in graphene-python. We need to implement get_query method of the SQLAlchemyConnectionField to filter on the attributes/columns of the model.\nCode for the same:\nclass MyConnectionField(SQLAlchemyConnectionField): # Below attributes/fields are for pagination and implemented by relay RELAY_ARGS = [\u0026#39;first\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;last\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;before\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;after\u0026#39;] @classmethod def get_query(cls, model, info, **args): query = super(MyConnectionField, cls).get_query(model, info, **args) for field, value in args.items(): if field not in cls.RELAY_ARGS: query = query.filter(getattr(model, field) == value) return query And now we can pass fields to be used for query filtering as part of our SQLAlchemyConnectionField:\nclass Query(graphene.ObjectType): node = graphene.relay.Node.Field() all_books = MyConnectionField(BookObject, title = graphene.String(), year = graphene.Int()) Now, we can query with filters using relay:\nquery{ allBooks(title:\u0026#34;Da Vinci Code\u0026#34;){ edges{ node{ id title } } } } And response for the above query:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;allBooks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;edges\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;node\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Qm9va09iamVjdDoy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Da Vinci Code\u0026#34; } } ] } } } For complete implementation of GraphQL in python using Flask, Graphene-Python, and SQLAlchemy, you can check the code on my GitHub.\nReferences # Introduction to GraphQL\nGithub GraphQL API\nGraphQL Schema Definition Language\nGraphQL-Flask\nSQLAlchemy instead of Flask-SQLAlchemy\nGraphene-Python\nHow to use Fields, Fragments, and more\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/2021/01/30/learning-right-from-wrongs/","title":"Learning right from wrongs","section":"posts","content":" Learn from the mistakes of others! You can’t live long enough to make them all yourselves. – Chanakya\nLife will not give us much time to try all the options to find the best possible answer/solution for problems life throws at us. Everyone is not blessed with the best opportunities to learn from the first or first few experiences. There is no right or wrong answer to the problems in life it is the perspective of one’s situation. For me, I was/am blessed to being part of things that were not right in my perspective or majoritarian society.\nThis article is merely my observations of life. I had a mixed bag of options/attempts/opportunities so far in life and this rant does not concern the best things that cropped up in my life. I would rather say, situations lacking the right or better approaches to problems in life. Deeper introspection of one’s life events/actions make us understand things that propelled us further and things that snowballed to impede our growth. Quoting Steve Jobs – “We can only connect dots by looking backward”, I am just attempting this approach to understand rights from my wrongs.\nWe (at least I) tend to see the value of something only when it becomes scarce. I had to realize the importance of things by doing an abundance of the exact opposite, by actually making it scarce.\nFew of the things I learned/understood by doing it wrong, some or most of it might seem obvious to you –\nWasting my (precious) time on things adding no value to my life thought me to value time. Time can never be earned, it can only be spent. I had a deep antipathy for socializing, I adored being a one-man army but now I realize the importance of it. Somebody making you part of their tribe is the highest calling one can have. I am impatient and anxious in life and work, which got me nothing and nowhere besides headaches. I have come to value the calmness that makes any problem in life approachable and solvable. I never lived fully (maybe when I was a kid) with my current consciousness, always on the edge worrying about the next and previous moves in my life. Due to which I could never immerse myself in any activity, which made me understand the importance of a focused mind at work and in life. Most (or all) of life I have lived for and with external validations, these validations contradicted with my belief system, changing in the process to questioning my own identity. I now understand the liberation and freedom of not having to prove. I always tend to expect something from others (usually a thing that shall add value to me) in the conversation else I tend to have lesser conversations with the individual but this has scarred me to live in isolation and self-doubt. I am letting go of expectations from conversations to listen and appreciate the other side for their time and wisdom. At work, I learned the importance of focus and time from people interrupting me and my team during intensely focused work. I have also learned the importance of words, less is always better. Venting about something and/or somebody is a curse in disguise, it might give relief but subconsciously breaks your character. I had to learn it the hard way and far better without it. These observations are mostly from the last few years of my life or I could introspect my life only recently. None of the above things might apply to you but things can be avoided without taking hard ways in life.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/posts/2020/09/08/living-with-no-goals/","title":"Living with No Goals","section":"posts","content":" “What keeps me going is goals” – Muhammad Ali\nOften, we fall into the pit of self-doubt, questioning our life and path to be carved for the future. Many are blessed to know their true goals but most (or at least me) do not have any goals.\nJust the thought of “no goals” brings me to the next pit in my mind, I was always under the belief that a man with no goals will choose a path downhill. Worries got my every moment the mind was not occupied, I could not sit still. Looking to the world for validation and confirmation of successful people for finding new inspiration and motivation did not take me far, it left me with a bigger void than before as weights of comparison were heavy. My extensive efforts were spent in choosing or finding the goal or motivation to move forward which eventually is to die down.\nIt is easy to conclude that we are letting our life slip by if we are not working towards our goals and having no goals is a far cry. COVID-19 pandemic allowed me to self-introspect, helping me realize important things in my life. It is okay to not have goals in life was one of the realizations, with nothing to strike but mend my life. My narrowed mind had always put goals before my wellbeing and happiness, hurting even more in the journey towards it. With a newfound realization, I have made peace with myself to live better and happy daily. I have no goals/passions of my own, all the things I strived or worked towards where circumstantial or influenced.\nMy biggest learning in recent weeks is to make my day better than yesterday and I only have present to work on it. To achieve success in life and career, you should have the right systems built making it your way of life to be successful, from Atomic Habits by James Clear. It cost me a great time when my happiness was externalized and had an illusion of control (or ego) over things in life and career. I have started living with a sense of purpose (a goal?) with one day at a time to make my life worthwhile for memories.\nMy penned down thoughts may not align with everyone, everyone has their way of living.

This very statement to others looks like being selfless and caring for others. But the act of selflessness never got into me because I do not see any act of any person as unselfish.\nNothing is unselfish in the world. Everything and everyone has the two perspectives, it is only a matter of the side one chooses. Many religious teachings tell us the happiness found in selflessness is everlasting but if we read between the lines it still concerns about the individual. The happiness we gain by helping others is a selfish act, achieved by sacrifices. No one is born (or thought) to be truly unselfish. According to me, a true act of unselfishness is when one gives but accepts nothing even if it is for gratitude. Gratitude is another variant of selfishness where a person thanks someone or something for the help received. What is unselfish in this world? Even nature is selfish when balancing it. Buddha preached his disciples and the world but was it not a selfish act of seeing a better world? Every thought of us is selfish, it changes the way the observer interprets it. If everything is selfish in this world then why struggle to achieve selflessness?\nHere is the story with two perspectives, a baby is lost in the forest and humans are in search. Human side: Tiger grabs the baby by its neck and runs into the forest. People chase it down and kill the tiger. Baby is saved by the miraculous efforts of humans. People saving the baby are now demi-gods to others. Tiger side: Tiger sees a lost baby and tries to help him out. Frightened men throw stones at him and the baby, tiger grabs hold of the baby like it’s own cub to save it from the humans. Humans chase it down and kill the tiger leaving a baby alone unhurt. Other tigers lose hope to connect with humans.\nSelflessness and selfishness are the mindsets of people and I don’t have a tool to distinguish people based on random acts of kindness. Observer decides to make better of the situation, which itself is an act of selfishness. I leave it to the reader to choose his side of observation either to make clever outcomes of the situation or letting the situation make outcomes.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/posts/2019/05/27/what-beach-taught-me/","title":"What beach taught me?","section":"posts","content":"Life is always a rough ride. There are weaker struggles as there are harder struggles. All of these struggles bring us the needed rewards. Life is filled with moments of giving and take.

It does not just teach natural farming, gives you valuable life lessons. It questions your lifestyle and teaches you self reliance.\nBiggest benefits shall come when we start to live in harmony with nature. We have disturbed it by bringing in technological advancements that are not sustainable or ecological. The farmer can make the greatest contribution to human development. Many problems can be addressed by the farmer. Being at source and close to nature, choices the farmer makes will make a big impact on the global scale. Our research tries to replicate nature but often fail to achieve the perfection of nature.\nIf we can right the wrongs of our approach with your basic needs, we can improve the quality of lives on Earth. We should stop the blame game and understand the problem, look for solutions.\nFoods that have departed far from their wild state and those raised by chemically unbalance the body chemistry. Eat local and seasonal fruits for better immunity. More chemicals we infuse into our crops/food more chemicals we put into our bodies resulting into unhealthy mind and body.\nWe are considering our needs based on appearance rather than the value it adds. We all want better-looking vegetables and food for which research is aiding the supplies with practices that move away from a natural way. The way we treat our earth is the same way we treat our body or vice versa.\nOur ancestors were primitive with technology but they stayed in harmony with nature. They did not intend to disturb the natural cycle of life on earth. They were definitely happy and nature aided to their happiness with the better yield for their hard work. We made technological advancements but away from nature, it does not look disturbing to plain eyes yet it is affecting the way of life on earth. Minimalistic living can make a profound impact on our lives.\n“When farmer began to grow crops to make money, he forgot the real principles of agriculture.” Culture is always entwined with our nature. The more we move away from it, the bigger the problem to solve. Mahatma Gandhi said – “The world has enough for everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed.” We moved away from our conventional methods of agriculture, we adapted to cash crops instead of ecological balancing crops that are best suited for better yield and need. All thanks to human intellect and capitalism.\nThere is fear of machines taking over our jobs. Big names in the industry want to bring in rules and universal income to address the cause. Who to blame when we actively adapted machines to meet our every need. We are making machines and chemicals to meet our needs. “A Community that cannot manage to produce its own food will not last long.” Green revolution(s) and machinery brought in techniques to produce more food. There is always a tradeoff between elements in the body, we are doing the same with our crops. Intensive research is adding more value to yield, instead of nutritional value. Nothing to blame when research approached to produce more to address the problem of the hour – food scarcity. Studies show we are producing more food and waste more. Is the problem with production or usage?\nWe fail to appreciate the perfection of nature, we come to understand only it’s wrath. We know nothing, we have illusions of intellectual mind to understand all of nature. Western/modern science teaches us to study objects in isolation or in a controlled environment but never in its wholesome interaction with the world around in its lifetime. “An object seen in isolation from the whole is not the real thing.” Most of the research is about using few tools for every operation. Same is true with technologically advanced crops, it proposes crops of higher yield for given parameters meaning to grow in the controlled fashion. Treatment of plants/crops goes in hand with the way we treat our fellow beings. More controlled the environment, more deprived will be one’s soul.\nPeople are committed to doing good to the world but their approach towards the problem is an inkling for newer problems. We are trying to fix our solutions instead of finding better solutions.\nI am no expert in agriculture but I understand the need of the hour. It is hard to move back to farming from a luxurious lifestyle with packed working hours. Make an attempt to improve your lifestyle in small ways like eat food locally to you, encourage a sustainable lifestyle.\nWith the end of the book, a question still lingers around “Can natural farming solve and meet our needs?”.\nThe beautiful excerpt on living in present:\n“Day by day hair and nails grow, tens of thousands of cells tens of thousands more are born; the blood in the body a month ago is not the same blood today. When you think that your own characteristics will be propagated in the bodies of your children and grandchildren, you could say that you are dying and being reborn each day, and yet will live on for many generations after death. If participation in this cycle can be experienced and savored each day, nothing more is necessary. But most people are not able to enjoy life as it passes and changes from day to day. They cling to life as they have already experienced it, and this habitual attachment brings fear of death. Paying attention only to the past, which has already gone, or to the future, which has yet to come, they forget that they are living on the earth here and now. Struggling in confusion, they watch their lives pass as in a dream.” Key Learnings:\nConventional knowledge/practice are not always the best options. Life is simple. Always see the problem as a whole, not in isolation. Learn to satisfy your needs only for a happier life. Minimal living, less is more. Always question your practices if they are ecologically balanced. Let go of past and expectations.

Of course, I am a dedicated individual and serious about my career but not life. I have listened and followed ideals to add richness to my living, they have given me direction when I had none but I have lost navigating in the process. I understand one cannot turn back the clock to make a different choice yet I cling to my past regretting of not living to my fullest.

I came to conclusion, there is no work-life balance upon reading articles on the web commenting “if work is interesting, one does not need to have work-life balance”.\nLately, I have started to hate going to work. I never experienced burnout, I guess I am making my way to it (or made it). A year ago, I was an employee with full of energy to give out more to my employer in the process of reinventing one self. But now I just want to complete the mile (no extra miles) to end my day. I have come from not believing to propagating work-life balance to my colleagues. I do not have a specific reason for this change, multiple reasons may have compounded the effect on to me.\nIs work-life balance necessary? Yes, it is necessary. We are beautiful creatures who have ability to separate different tasks at our hand, but most of us get stuck at one thing most of our day (work). Our work has become recurring event of our daily activities (besides working hours), affecting our efficiency leading to a stressful life. For someone like me, who hates/fears to step away from work to avoid more work or having no courage to move out of the zone adds more stress to your unhappy life. You can be happy by avoiding empathy with your work/employer but it is difficult route to take when one has given most of himself to betterment of work and growth of the company. Other choice would be to have the courage to speak up to your boss/employer about your preferences on work and life.\nWork-Life balance is very much essential to have better productive work and happy life. For beginners, it might seem foolish to separate out work from life because it might look unproductive or less dedication to their work. And for people putting out their soul into work for building the brand of the company, work-life balance does not dictate their moves but they will be losing out something costly or dearly to their lives – happiness. You may be a workhorse and feel proud about it, but think again about what it is costing your life with? I am not here to disorient people willing to become workhorse and still define happier life with their own defined balance between work and life (or work is life for some).\nBreaking the regular pattern might be hard because of your ethics or fear to hurt the impression of your own self. Sometimes, it becomes hard to choose the options given. For me, I have little courage to hurt my impression by rowing my boat against the direction of wind.

Greater support from big names like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft has spearheaded the progress in the field. The stronger foundation was laid by Alan Turing in 1950 with his thesis famously known as \u0026ldquo;Turing Test\u0026rdquo;. And even the great man predicted 2000s would be year of AI. But due to failure in technological advancements and fear over ungoverned AI led to winters for decades together leading to no growth in respective field.\nEthics has been major concern over Artificially intelligent machines. Greatest minds like Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, Elon Musk have feared over Super artificial intelligent machine. Later has even created a company named OpenAI to openly work and review the work carried in development of AI. We are strongly concerned with rules and ethics to be defined for AI machine to save our future from clutches of super intelligent machines.\nGod is the only being or myth that we have followed or feared and lived by through ages. Some of us abide while others question his existence, but still is part of our everyday life either in form myth or super being. We still make decisions assuming someone (God) is keeping track of our rights and wrongs. And one always tries do rights. We still are god fearing people (most of us) i.e we live by his code of conduct. We still consider him to be superior and fear in committing any wrongs.\nThen why not bring/introduce the idea of God in AI, where rules are defined in a way holy books are to us. Making the idea of God as superior to an advanced AI can remove the evil thoughts. As there is good and bad likewise God and Devil. But likewise we are thought that God always wins over Devil/ Satan, we can train the AI same way to understand God and teaching it do good deeds to humanity. Like we question his existence, an advanced AI might also question the same and start exploring for him. And it’s exploration might lead us to many more discoveries and wonders that we failed to see or find. The famous laws of robotics defined by Issac Asimov might be violated or modified accrodingly by an advanced AI but not when it stays in fear of some superior being like God, like we stay in our limits when have superior in form of God.\nThese are my thoughts over ethics for Artificial Intelligent machine, it might raise many questions in comparison of our lives in this modern world. I am open for comments and explanations for failure in this approach.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/posts/2016/11/18/gifts/","title":"Gifts","section":"posts","content":"Are they given or taken?\nGod gifted the nature or nature gifted us the beauty of his notion?\nWe gift or we gifted?\nGifts to be happy or make happy?\nIs it everyones’ or someone’s?\nIs it worth keeping or sharing?\nAre we gifts to our parents or they are gift to us?\nIs any gift worth it to one’s self to gift?\nWe are gifted and hope to be one.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/posts/2016/08/08/god-and-man/","title":"God and Man","section":"posts","content":"Existence of him has long been a question to us from the beginning of our consciousness. Scientists are finding him by unwrapping the truths to our existence by understanding the beginning of us and our universes’ (contrary to multiple universes) existence. Religionists find him in holy books and places they preached and constructed for. And some abide by his rules while some disregard him as their creator. Just the question of his existence has led many kind of wars and people around the world, atheist v/s theists, one god v/s many god believers, scientists v/s religionists, people who fear to those who love. Throughout the history of mankind, we have searched and found relief in the belief of his existence. We the mankind have created him and his religions, whereas many go against this notion of their creator. Some believe in the prophecies and teachings of their religion, while some question the same teachings.\nFrom the knowledge of many theologists and religionists, we have come to know him as supremo of all beings. We are known to draw inspiration from our role models who are mere mortals like you and everyone else. Some see him as allah, some others pray him as jesus, others see him in many other forms. People have prayed and sought blessings from him of which one is to clear all their sins. From the beginning of man kind we have feared him in all means while some have believed in loving him instead of being feared. We have never learnt to draw inspiration from him like we do with our role models instead of fearing and praying. We fail to do so because he/she is considered supreme to us i.e God. Many movies and books have portrayed him as strong force and one to be feared if not lived by his rules.\nWe all have heard stories of our gods’ from our parents and holy books. We are told of his great encounters with his enemies and saving our mankind from clutches of destruction by demons/devils/satans. We all are admired and impressed by such stories but never quite inspired by his heroic acts. As I come from family where God is considered as ultimate and above all, we are used to poly-god theory. We have prayed and performed many rituals to many of deities in our religion but many of us have failed to draw inspiration from one of these deities. Is it wrong to draw inspiration from our gods? If not why do we draw some from role models who are not gods? From all the gods I have prayed and sought blessings from are unique in their abilities like patience, timing sense, intelligence into situations, centered and concentrated in chaos and confusion and many more. But all we do and did is just pray blindly and fail to learn from the gods we pray daily. Instead of seeking for blessings and guidance during hard times one can draw inspiration and live accordingly to solve and move out from one’s hard time. I believe god and his religion are there/created just to be considered as supreme being to seek from but learn to be guide and light to your path and problems. I wish seeking inspiration from one’s god is understanding and improving oneself.\nThis is my own view of perceiving things, it is not to be contradicted with.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/posts/2015/09/24/human-and-machine/","title":"Human and Machine","section":"posts","content":"What is Intelligence? It is comprised of logic,understanding,self-awareness,creativity, planning and so on, which elevates humans from other animals (of course we humans are animals). The people review one’s intelligence quotient with stupid, illogical tests and rate them with score. But we are meant to use our intelligence beyond what is known and not let those groundless tests alias quizzes mark our intelligence.\nNow we have come across definition of human Intelligence, let’s make a turn towards inanimate machines. In recent years technology mags,papers, reviews are buzzing with the machine intelligence called Artificial Intelligence. It is ability of machine to have human like intelligence, but sadly we have not reached this sophisticated stage, which is both a delight and disappointment to mankind.\nBoth man and man-made machines have achieved a great feats which are incomparable when compared to each other (it’s obvious that man made these machines). The man is great at making decisions while machines are accurate. He is the one who made calculus but weak at faster calculation ( except to humans like Shakuntala Devi who belittled machine with her speed of calculation) which is dominated by our machines. Machines are limited to using there resources like we limited to our resources. Scientists are digging deep to tap more resources of both kind.\nScientists have seen and brought great advancements in Artificial Intelligence. Some concluded that machines will overtake us in far future while some disregarded the same. But only few could notice the united power of the intelligence i.e Human and Machine. It dates back to first and greatest game of chess played between the all time chess champion Garry Kasparov and IBM’s Deep blue , in which Kasparov lost with a understanding that when there is symbiosis of human and machine intelligence the things that can be achieved will be remarkable.\nImagine the intelligence with a potential to make huge calculations in fraction of seconds, make decisions that are human in nature, greater peace in the world we live and so on. This is all possible with symbiosis of human and machine intelligence. We can carve out our new future possibilities with existing old impossibilities. If possible we can put an end to endless problems like diseases, epidemics etc in near future. We can make possible what was thought impossible, that machines can live with harmony with humans, which was presumed that machine will one day overtake human race.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/posts/2015/05/01/benjamin-franklin-virtues/","title":"Benjamin Franklin's virtue","section":"posts","content":"Every successful person has is own traits to be successful in life.

It has helped us getting solutions for the problems and at the same time making new problems to us. Now you may be thinking about the boon and bane of the Technology with and to our life.\nThe Technology has grown and become so part of our life, we can’t survive without it in our life, whereas vice versa is unimaginable. The greatest boon with advent of the technology is it’s ability to make things simpler to human beings. But the same technology has made and is making us to keep distance from our mother nature. The same nature which made our days of childhood fun and filled it with life has become a distant person to us. The great visionaries think of the future of our mother earth, which they feel should be given most importance than any other thing on the earth. On the other side ,we pay least importance to our mother earth and are completely engrossed into so called technology. It’s like two sides of a coin, one face which matter to us and other face which we must matter to care.\nWhen was the last time you have been in the rain, that mother earth showers with love on us? How many times did you think of the mother earth to save it from suffering we have given?\nI hope these questions do matter now to you else not anytime. The technology has made our life easy to a extent which is making life of our mother nature tougher to same extent. We are planning and in search of new Earth-like planets, so that we can build new civilization on it. With these great ideas we are forgetting our mother Earth which supported us for generations. I hope it’s not late to act to save our mother Earth from us. It’s time we pay back to our mother, Let’s save it from dieing.\nI am not here to conclude that technology is the bigggest problem for human race or life. But not to neglect our mother in use of it. I wish that everyone use the technology so that it dawns new changes in our lives but not bring dusk on our mother Earth.\nInaction to a cause is being against the cause of it. So make action in your lives for betterment of our Earth and our life.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/about/","title":"about","section":"","content":" About # I am an engineer at Nutanix where I work with team offering platform as a service for internal customers to run their services, I am currently involved in making Kubernetes available as a platform.
