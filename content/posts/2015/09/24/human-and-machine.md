What is Intelligence? It is comprised of logic,understanding,self-awareness,creativity, planning and so on, which elevates humans from other animals (of course we humans are animals). The people review one’s intelligence quotient with stupid, illogical tests and rate them with score. But we are meant to use our intelligence beyond what is known and not let those groundless tests alias quizzes mark our intelligence.

Now we have come across definition of human Intelligence, let’s make a turn towards inanimate machines. In recent years technology mags,papers, reviews are buzzing with the machine intelligence called Artificial Intelligence. It is ability of machine to have human like intelligence, but sadly we have not reached this sophisticated stage, which is both a delight and disappointment to mankind.

Both man and man-made machines have achieved a great feats which are incomparable when compared to each other (it’s obvious that man made these machines). The man is great at making decisions while machines are accurate. He is the one who made calculus but weak at faster calculation ( except to humans like Shakuntala Devi who belittled machine with her speed of calculation) which is dominated by our machines. Machines are limited to using there resources like we limited to our resources. Scientists  are digging deep to tap more resources of both kind.

Scientists have seen and brought great advancements in Artificial Intelligence. Some concluded that machines will overtake us in far future while some disregarded the same. But only few could notice the united power of the intelligence i.e Human and Machine. It dates back to first and greatest game of chess played between the all time chess champion Garry Kasparov and IBM’s Deep blue , in which Kasparov lost with a understanding that when there is symbiosis of human and machine intelligence the things that can be achieved will be remarkable.

Imagine the intelligence with a potential to make huge calculations in fraction of seconds, make decisions that are human in nature, greater peace in the world we live and so on. This is all possible with symbiosis of human and machine intelligence. We can carve out our new future possibilities with existing old impossibilities. If possible we can put an end to endless problems like diseases, epidemics etc in near future. We can make possible what was thought impossible, that machines can live with harmony with humans, which was presumed that machine will one day overtake human race.
