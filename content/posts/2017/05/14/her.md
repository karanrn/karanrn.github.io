Things of my world have changed irrespective of changes in the world but one that never changed is her.

Hatred and greed were pushed to corner of my heart by the love and compassion of her.

Life kicked me hard when I had to move away from her.

Clouds might have missed to shower me with rain but she never missed to shower me with all the love and caring.

No best perfume can beat the aroma of the food prepared by her.

She is no less than any god(s) we pray.

People and world around have taught me all of the things except the love showered by her.

No artist can capture her in a portrait unless she does.

Nothing can contain the amount of sacrifices done by her.

Nothing can be compared to her so the reason we consider our planet as mother earth.

No game in the history is based on her because no one wants lose her.

In the mirror of life she is my mirror.

We count time in seconds,minutes,days and years but I can’t count a day without her.

Anything can die in this world but not the caring and love from her.

Mother’s​ are special beings and mother is mother itself but nothing else.

Happy Mother’s day
