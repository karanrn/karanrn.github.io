# About
I am an engineer at [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/) where I work with team offering platform as a service for internal customers to run their services, I am currently involved in making Kubernetes available as a platform. Before this, I worked at [DataGrokr](https://www.datagrokr.com/) migrating on-prem solutions to cloud, enhancing usability and reducing costs of operations.

I am interested in distributed systems, infrastructure engineering (cloud-native). I also dabbled with Machine Learning, bit of decentralized applications.

Apart from work, I spend time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37190680-karan) or watching movies.
